## Usage

Get the data from Jenna. 

Do the training/reliability file first: `python reliabilityCli.py -f /path/to/reliability.csv -n "Your Name"`

Then go ahead and work on the main file: `python annotatorCli.py -f /path/to/master.csv -n "Your Name"`

If you somehow ran out of reports or only want to look at scan reasons and histories: `python scanReasonOnlyCli.py -f /path/to/master.csv -n "Your Name"`
