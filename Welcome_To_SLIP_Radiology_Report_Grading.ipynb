    "## SLIP Radiology Report Grading Welcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the SLIP project. The project was started with the intention to curate a set of clinically acquired Scans with Limited Imaging Pathology. The ongoing retrospective data collection process begins with checking the radiology reports (semi-structured written summaries of the contents of a scan). Because these scans are clinically acquired, a scan with no pathology cannot be marked as \"healthy\". Rather, scans are often marked as \"unremarkable\" or \"appearing normal\" to indicate a lack of finding. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training for SLIP report grading has 3 steps:\n",
    "1. Reading SLIP and non-SLIP report examples\n",
    "2. Practicing rating a subset of 150 reports\n",
    "3. Grade a set of \"shared\" reports used for calculating reliability ratings"

    "The grades are on an ordinal scale of 0/1/2 where\n",
    "- Rating 0: Suspect serious imaging pathology\n",
    "- Rating 1: Neither a 0 nor a 2 (AKA “I don’t know”). These are people who may or may not be included in our analyses depending on the context.\n",
    "- Rating 2: No reason to suspect imaging pathology. These are people whose imaging pathology would likely not exclude them from being part of a control cohort in research brain MRI study. Note that this is different from their PAST MEDICAL HISTORY potentially excluding them, which is a different issue.\n",
