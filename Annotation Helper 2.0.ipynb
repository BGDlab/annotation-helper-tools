    "The second cell loads the radiology reports and looks for reports that have not been labelled as CLIP or not CLIP yet. It prints the narrative text column for a single report and highlights any occurrences of the specified wordsToHighlight. \n",

    "It asks 'Does the patient belong in the \"Cohort with Limited Imaging Pathology\"? (y/n/skip)'. In the text box, enter y for yes, n for no, or skip to skip the report if you want to come back to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then asks \"What would you like to do next? (n for next unannotated report/p for previous/r to redo current report/s for save/e for exit)\". In the text box, enter the letter corresponding to your choice and press enter."
