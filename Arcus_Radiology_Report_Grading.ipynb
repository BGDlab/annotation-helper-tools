Follow-up evaluation for interval change. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal 3D T1 gradient echo with axial reformations axial and coronal TSE T2 axial and coronal FLAIR axial SWI arterial spin labeled perfusion imaging and axial diffusion imaging were performed on a 3.0 Tesla system.

It causes mild \u001b[5;30;41mMASS\u001b[0m effect and distortion of the underlying brain and 7 mm rightward shift of the midline structures unchanged. There is prominent anterior medial component with extension slightly across the midline unchanged. There is mild inferior displacement of the left tentorial leaflet and mild rightward displacement of the medial temporal lobe and the left cerebral peduncle unchanged. Mild thinning and smooth scalloping of the overlying bone unchanged. The \u001b[5;30;41mCYST\u001b[0m approximately measures 11 x 6.5 x 10 mm in the AP x transverse x craniocaudad dimensions. Overall there is no significant change since the prior \u001b[5;30;43mMRI\u001b[0m. There is mild narrowing of the left retro-orbital region without any significant \u001b[5;30;41mMASS\u001b[0m effect on the optic nerve sheath complex. The left intracranial segment of the left optic nerve the optic chiasm and the pituitary infundibulum remain slightly displaced to the right. There is mild effacement of the underlying left lateral ventricle and mild displacement of the third ventricle to the right. The remainder of the ventricular system is normal in size and configuration. \u001b[5;30;47mTHERE ARE NO INTRACRANIAL MASS LESIONS\u001b[0m and there is \u001b[5;30;47mNO MASS EFFECT OR MIDLINE SHIFT\u001b[0m. \u001b[5;30;47mTHERE ARE NO AREAS OF ABNORMAL PARENCHYMAL SIGNAL INTENSITY\u001b[0m on these sequences. \u001b[5;30;47mTHE VISUALIZED MAJOR INTRACRANIAL VESSELS APPEAR PATENT\u001b[0m. \u001b[5;30;47mNO DEFINITE ABNORMALITY IS SEEN IN THE VISUALIZED PORTIONS OF THE \u001b[5;30;43mORBIT\u001b[0mS\u001b[0m.
